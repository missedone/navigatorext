Overview

The original idea comes from JCommander which provides a plug-in can call out system shell menu implemented with MFC, 
but the plug-in only worked for JCommander, I copied some codes and release first version based on JCommander 

Features:
1. Add context menu action in "Package Explorer View", to call out the system context menu corresponding to the selected resource (win32/win64 os only)

2. Copy the resource's name, full path, or parent path into clipboard.
